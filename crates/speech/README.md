# filmcraft-speech

Speech-to-text for FilmCraft's Text panel ▸ Transcript (L2). User-facing behaviour, commands and
model handling: [docs/transcripts.md](../../docs/transcripts.md).

- `Transcriber` trait (mono 16 kHz in, word-timed `filmcraft_project::Transcript` out) and
  `FixedTranscriber` for tests and agents.
- `models`: Whisper model catalogue (pinned revisions, SHA-256, sizes, licences) and, with feature
  `download`, the verified downloader (ureq + rustls + RustCrypto). Weights are never bundled.
- `whisper` (feature `whisper`): Whisper inference on candle (CPU, pure Rust).
- `mel`, `vad`, `diarize`: log-mel front end, word-bound tightening, MFCC-clustering speaker labels.

Both features are off by default and are never enabled for wasm (`cargo xtask wasm` checks the
crate without them).

Word alignment retains a leading prompt row and a trailing end-of-text row in the
attention path. Only text-token rows become word timings, so audio before the
first word is not forced into that word. Energy-based trimming then removes
quiet edges; timing remains an estimate (20 ms attention, 10 ms energy frames).
